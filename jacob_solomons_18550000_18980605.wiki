== Biography ==

Jacob came to England in the 1880s from somewhere that was a part of Russia Poland.  It is not known whether he had known his wife, [[Levinson-273 | Hannah Levison]], before they arrived in England or afterwards.  If they were married in England then their marriage may have taken place on 29 December 1880 at the Princess Street Synagogue.

The Bride is named "Annie", but this is also the case in a later Census.  Their ages and the difference between them do not agree with later documents, but this could just be a guess on the part of the Registrar as both "Annie" and Jacob have signed the certificate with their mark.  This is why this is a candidate for their marriage.

The 1881 Census took place approximately three months after this marriage took place.  There is a married couple called Jacob and Hannah Solomons living in 8 Little Patternoster Row, Spitalfields.  They have the same ages as the earlier Marriage Certificate.  The birth place for both is Poland.  Jacob and Hannah's occupation is listed as Tailor and Tailoress respectively.<ref>

The houses in Little Patternoster Row were very small and number 8 backed onto Crispin Street.  Jacob and Hannah's first child was born in the same street but at number 12 Little Patternoster Row.  Her Birth Certificate has the family living at 13 Crispin Street.  This house was north of Little Patternoster Row under what is now Spitalfields Market (2022).  Hannah may have given birth in the home of someone she new from her time living in Little Patternoster Row, but it is also possible the family were living in Little Patternoster Row when Esther was born and had moved out by the time it was registerred over a month later on 29 October 1881.  Esther's birth certificate associates the family with Little Patternoster Row, and increases the liklihood the family lived there, but doesn't prove they did.<ref>

The 1891 Census also shows the whole family living at 31 & 32 Booth Street Buildings.  Looking through the 1891 Census for all the Booth Street Buildings addresses, one can see there are 3 buildings where 31 & 32 are in building 2.  This explains why the address on the Birth Certificates is different to the Census. Jacob is a Tailor or Tailor Machinist on all the birth certificates and both Hannah and Jacob are Tailor Machinists on the 1891 Census.<ref>

Jacob contracted Consumption about a year before Rebecca was born.  This is a wasting disease such as Pulminary Tuberculosis.  Jacob's health would have been deteriorating leading up to the birth of Rebecca, and without an available cure, it was a matter of time before he succombed to the disease.  Thirteen months after the birth of his last daughter, Jacob died at 22 Thomas Street on 5 June 1898.  His death certificate says he was 43 years old, and gives the cause of death as: ``Consumption of the lungs (Tuberculosis) (2 years)``<ref>
