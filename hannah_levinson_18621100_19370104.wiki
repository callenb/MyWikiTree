== Biography ==

Hannah came to England in the 1880s from somewhere in Eastern Europe, which may have been Russia or Prussia. She was very special to her great grandaughter [[Schemerofsky-1 |jacqueline (Schemerofsky) Callender]]. Hannah died in 1937 whilst holding the hand of the eight year old Jacqueline in a room in the house where they both lived at 1 Regal Place, Old Montague Street in Whitechapel, London.<ref name="CONVO-JC">

    [[Schemerofsky-1 |jacqueline (Schemerofsky) Callender]] also known as Jacqueline Morris. Took place over 30 years and some notes made.

Hannah and [[Solomons-288 | Jacob Solomons]] may have been married in London, but it is not known for sure.  If this was the case, then a likely candidate for their marriage was one that took place on 29 December 1880 at the Princess Street Synagogue.

The name of the bride is "Annie" not Hannah, but there is a Census we will see later on where this is also the case.  The other difference is the ages of Bride and Groom, but this could be a guess by the register, as both had signed the marriage certificate using an X and so could not write or speak english.

The next record which could be them is at 8 Little Patternoster Row according to the England and Wales Census of 1881<ref name="1881Census">

</ref> Here we find a married couple called Jacob and Hannah Solomons with the same ages as was on the earlier Marriage Certificate.  The birth place for both is Poland and Jacob is a Tailor and Hannah a Tailoress.

The houses in Little Patternoster Row were very small and they backed onto Crispin Street.  Jacob and Hannah's first child was born in 12 Little Patternoster Row, whilst they were living at 13 Crispen Street.  This house was north of Little Patternoster Row under what is now Spitalfields Market (2022).  There is the possibility of Hannah giving birth in the home of someone she new from her time living in Little Patternoster Row.  The birth certificate of their first child, [[Solomons-287 | Esther Solomons]] associates the family with Little Patternoster Row, though doesn't prove they ever lived there<ref name="BC1">

The father on Esther's birth certificate is a Tailor called Jacob Solomons and her mother is listed as Hannah Solomons, formerly Levinson.  Her birth was registered over a month later on 29 October 1881.  There is the possibility the family was living in Little Patternoster Row and moved soon after Esther was born, but before her birth was registered.

Hannah's second child was a boy called Hyman.  He was born on 13 June 1883 in 2 New Buildings, Booth Street.<ref name="BC2">
