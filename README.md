# WikiTree
I am using git to manage the work I do on [WikiTree](https://wikitree.com) and I've been experimenting as I go along. My aim is to get as many stubs added to WikiTree as I can working back generation by generation from myself, and filling in siblings and spouses as I go.  At times I will add other relatives.

Each person has two files, one listing the sources applicable to them and another containing their BIO.

A "stub" is a profile with at least one source added into WikiTree as a starting point to build up my family tree.  In addition to my family tree I have some Friends and Neighbour (FAN) profiles which may well turn out to be family.  I hope most of my stubs have Birth, Marriage and Death sources, but thatis not always possible.

I have realised I have lost track of what I have added to WikiTree verses what I have just updated in this reporsitory so I have introduced a Changelog to identify that.  I will probably add tags as well.
